# Privacy Policy for GlassNotes

**Last Updated: November 14, 2025**

## Introduction

GlassNotes ("the App") is developed and maintained by Robert DelFave. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.

## The Short Version

**GlassNotes does not collect, store, or share any of your personal data.** Your notes stay on your device and in your iCloud account. We never see them.

## Information Collection and Use

### What We DON'T Collect

GlassNotes does NOT collect:
- Personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Usage analytics or statistics
- Crash reports
- Location data
- Device information
- Any data whatsoever

### Your Notes and Data

- **Local Storage**: All notes are stored locally on your Mac in your user documents folder
- **iCloud Sync**: If you have iCloud enabled on your Mac, your notes automatically sync to your iCloud account
- **Your Control**: You own and control all your notes. They are stored in standard formats and are accessible to you at all times
- **No Server**: We do not operate any servers. Your notes never leave your devices or iCloud account

### iCloud

If you choose to use iCloud on your device:
- Your notes will sync across your Apple devices signed in to the same iCloud account
- This sync is handled entirely by Apple's iCloud service
- GlassNotes never sees or accesses your data
- Apple's iCloud Privacy Policy applies: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

## Third-Party Services

GlassNotes does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Data Security

Since your data never leaves your device (except via Apple's iCloud, which you control), your notes are as secure as your Mac and iCloud account.

## Children's Privacy

GlassNotes does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
